      "message": "I loved working with Luke. He came onto a team that was well established, but had some tricky issues to figure out and Luke jumped in head first right from the start. While he was diligent in the day to day needs of the team, one thing that stood out to me was that Luke would often look ahead to understand what was needed by him or his team in the future. His ability to understand both the macro and micro view of the team's projects was very impressive. Luke was also very diligent in his own personal growth. We talked many times about skills that he would like to develop, both for his own edification and to fulfill his team's needs, and Luke was always thoughtful about managing plans to develop those skills. He definitely has a growth mindset that I appreciated. I would gladly work with Luke again and think he would be a great asset on whatever organization he works with."

    "early-life": "My interest in programming started early, from playing with and eventually taking apart my electronics. I just had to understand how they worked. I take pride in my ability to learn anything related to computers. From video editing, photo editing, web development, 3D illustration I have yet to find a discipline of computer applications that doesnt spark the joy of learning.",
    "early-career": "After graduating from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth I joined Dell EMC. My first years of employment helped me understand the full development lifecycle. Being in a role surrounded by colleagues with decades of experience helped me to envisage concepts of computer architecture that we invisible to me before. However, this role left me wanting to take on a leadership role myself.",
    "present-day": "I found my stride at Pluralsight LLC, where I was able to lead a product aquisition team and evaluate and plan key changes to both platforms moving forward. I showed that not only was I capable of full stack development, but could actively guide a team in that role. In my next role I'm looking for a project that ignites my passion to learn and allows me to work with individuals who are as eager as I am to create elegant and cutting edge technology."
